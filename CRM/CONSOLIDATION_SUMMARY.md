## 🔧 TECHNICAL PROCESS

### Deduplication Strategy
Contacts were deduplicated using this priority:
1. **Email match** (primary key)
2. **LinkedIn profile match** (secondary key)
3. **Name + University match** (tertiary key)

### Data Merging Logic
When duplicates were found:
- Keep most complete data for each field
- Merge notes (combine rather than overwrite)
- Combine sources (track all data origins)
- Preserve manual CRM data over automated scrapes

### Column Standardization
Created unified 24-column schema:
- Owner, Priority, Probability, Target £
- University Name, Contact Name, First/Last Name
- Job Title, Faculty, Email, LinkedIn
- Source, Lead Type, Action Status
- Last Contact, Next Contact, Notes
- Role Category, Area, Partnership Purpose
- Organisation Type, Created Date, Status
